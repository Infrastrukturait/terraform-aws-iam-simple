    "Terraform Module to provision a basic IAM user suitable for CI/CD Systems or systems which are *external*",
    "to AWS that cannot leverage [AWS IAM Instance Profiles](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html)",
    "or [AWS OIDC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html).",
    "By default, IAM users, groups, and roles have no access to AWS resources.",
    "IAM policies are the means by which privileges are granted to users, groups, or roles.",
    "It is recommended that IAM policies be applied directly to groups and roles but not users.",
    "**This module intentionally attaches an IAM policy directly to the user and does not use groups**",
    "If an AWS Access Key is created, it is stored either in [AWS Secret Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) or is provided as a module output, but not both.",
    "Using [AWS Secret Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) is recommended because module outputs are stored in plaintext in the Terraform state file.",
    "[AWS Secret Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) is provisioning by [external module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Infrastrukturait/secret-manager/aws/latest)."
